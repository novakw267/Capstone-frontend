## Technology I used
  I used Ember to structure my frontend, which made it easier to create the display and add all the buttons, links, and views. It also allowed for an easy connection to my backend via its similarity with ruby on rails.

## My approach to building this
  My approach was centered around structuring an app that would allow a user to blog about anything music related. I also wanted to add the ability for users to comment on posts and talk to each other.

  I started on the backend to create the structure of the blogs and the what the users would have access to. I then after creating the relationships and things I wanted to include in the blogs went to the front end.

  There I started creating the ability for a user to see blogs posted, and then the form fields to allow a user to submit their own posts.
  They can also update and delete their posts.

## Installation Instructions

1) Npm install
2) Bower install

## User Stories
As a user:
- I want to sign up and be able to store my posts.
- When I sign in I want to be abel to see my posts.
- I want to be able to create, edit, and delete my own posts.
- I want to share my posts with other users.
- I want to be able to view the newest posts by any user.
- I do not want other users to be able to edit my content.
- I want to be able to comment on other user's posts and them to be able to on my posts.

## Pitch
  With this project my goal was to create a place where users can blog about music. I wanted to be able to add the spotify api, so users could be able to add their playlists, spotify profiles, and bands they love in their posts.
  A big inspiration for this was the fact that I don't know a lot of people that love certain types of music the way I do. I wanted to eventually create a resource that would be great for finding other people that love the same kind of music you do.
  One day this is going to be the app for finding new music and connecting with others who love and follow music the way you do.

## Challenges and Future Additions'

  A major challenge for this project was learning ember as I went. It created a lot of problems through having to learning a brand new syntax. However Ember also once I had an understanding of it, saved a ton of time structuring my front end.
  Another big thing I conquered was setting up the relationships on the back end. I ran into issues having the relationships talk to each other at first. I was able to find the problem and fix it.

  In the future I want to refactor this app, and add a couple of things.
  I would love to add the spotify or Itunes api. This would be so users can reference easily the music that they're talking about. I also would love to add the ability to comment on posts, and chat between users.
